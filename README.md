# Expo Constants.deviceId Inconsistency Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where `Constants.deviceId` in Expo inconsistently returns `null` or an empty string.  This can disrupt features relying on unique device identification.

## Bug Description

The `Constants.deviceId` property, intended to provide a unique identifier for a device, sometimes returns an unexpected `null` or empty string. This behavior is not consistent across devices or Expo versions, making it difficult to reliably identify and track users.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the `bug.js` example using Expo Go or a similar Expo development environment.
3. Observe the inconsistent results of `Constants.deviceId`.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a potential workaround using AsyncStorage or other persistent storage mechanisms to maintain user identification, even when `Constants.deviceId` fails to provide a reliable value.  This approach uses a combination of the `Constants.deviceId` and a fallback mechanism for situations where the ID is unavailable. More robust unique identifiers should be considered for production environments.
